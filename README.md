# Timmy

Timmy is a simple time management utility for the command line.

For now, it only supports adding entries, starting and stopping them. It will also calculate the total time spent on each entry.

In the future, I plan to add more features like editing entries, deleting entries, and fetching entries from a remote server like Toggl.

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

Just build and run the executable. It will create a `.timmy-entries` directory in your home directory and store all entries there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snturk/timmy.git
cd timmy
go build
./timmy --help
```
